Welcome

<intro>
Just a moment...

And now you're waiting

<introPleaseWait>

Waiting for the presentation to start
and it took a while
15 seconds to be precise

how react to this time in various emotions
bored, annoyed, frustrated, excited, 
can't wait to start 

how you feel is dependent what you expect.
some of you chose this talk because interesting
some of you didnt find anything else and just wanted to a chair to set

What is waiting?
Waiting is experiencing time
phylosopical approach 
movies, books, art and science have already covered that
cheesy to talk about it   
summarize
that time is pretty important to everything

time has to be differentiated into real time and perceived time
cinema in bremen
sneak preview
everything from transformers or french family drama
entertained or touched by the movie 2 hours feel much shorter
bored and uninteresetd in the movie feels much longer

to summarize with a famous quote:

<albertGirl>

"If you're sitting with a nice person for hours, it feels like a minute."

<albertStove>

"If you're sitting on a hot stove for a minute, it feels like hours"
guessed its from albert einstein. 

perceive time is dependend of the context its happening in.  
And this applies to literally everything. 
And that everything obviously includes software. 

<title>

Talking about
"The perception of time in user interfaces"
I'm Andr√© Schmidt - Di Salvo
the senior flutter & android developer at Open Xchange
software development for around 20 years
developed for startups and also multinational cooperations

one thing in common
all software needs to load 
which makes the user to wait

waiting requires one fuel 
that is patience

<patience>

and when patience is lost a reaction will follow
if i dont like the movie in the cinema i can leave

some game -> uninstall
game i preordered -> excited while , change to frustration
cloud storage -> frustrated, annoyed 

if patience of user runs out, a bad review is immenent.
So we need to handle his patience.

but first we have to ask the question:
how long is too long?


<military>

many papers and standards about time 
for example, in 1968 "Response Time in Man-Computer Conversational Transactions" 
and many standards for the millitary sector
where its even critical that a process finishes in a given time 

For our talk
Lets start with the category 
that is sometimes not even regarded as a waiting time 
its called it "Now"

<now>

Example: you open whatsapp, telegram, whatever
create and you send it
and it appears in your chat

how much time do we have for something feel instant?
the answer is 50 milliseconds

<nowEye>

how long we need to become concious of a stimulus 

if we breach the limit the user will feel a lag
which is basically micro waiting

even if its just a chat bubble to display, 
50 ms not a lot of time
our code: complex UI, especially in flutter, 
if our tree of widgets is written poorly
but we can optimize and benchmark our own code
and hooray, we got under 50ms   
...on our test device

chaos is ruling our app
<hardware>
many factors we dont know
usually we dont know much
about the device we're running on: how old, how powerful
about the state of the system: battery saver 
about other apps affecting our apps performance

so optimizing far below our 50ms for presentation is key
because you just dont know how your app will be affected

very petty to think about such lags
if many lags your whole app feels sluggish
or your new feature even stands out 
because its the only part of the app that lags

in our example there's one trick:
we fake it till we make it

lets go through everything that needs to be done for message to be send
- persistence
- networking
- presentation
we primarily pretend that its done
and if it takes a while or even fails due to being offline, a tiny indicator lets us know

But what if it takes noticiable longer than an instant? 
lets find out in our next category:
In A Moment

<in a moment>

And a fine example is a login
you enter your username and password and login

Here we can't fake it till we make it
we dont have anything
if our login data is correct, we have to get all kinds of data and resources to prepare our app for the user 

king of chaos
<the internet>
the internet
about milliseconds from hardware and processes
but the internet is something different 

a bit philosophical
browser -> web site = thats not the internet
thats data on a server
the internet is time to wait until web site is ready

just think of all the factors of this waiting time
are you on wifi or on mobile signal?
are you one of those awfully slow free wifis? 
or at home with your fast wifi?
if your on mobile signal:
in the city center? or on a train going into a tunnel?
is the server next door or in greenland?

you dont know
so the time ranges from milliseconds to theoretically infinity

<infinity>

only solution again infinity
abort after a timeouts
usually about 10 seconds
but beware 
in case of huge datasets not the not connection is cause
but the server work
carefully select the timeout to respect the server work

you remember the beginning of the presentation
10 seconds is pretty long 

so what if we need longer than 10 seconds

<later>

enter "later"

example: again the login

if an important process takes longer than usual
excuse yourself
this is taking longer than usual.
please wait.

we can evaluate certain things
and inform the user accordingly
know the amount of data to expect
identify the connection type
inform the user
option to cancel by himself 

example: a game loading

huge amounts of assets like textures have to be loaded

<rpg>

games got creative over the years
the decorated screens 
like role playing games give you tips and hints
or racing games showing statistics

even in 1993, strike commander
revolutionary graphics for the time, took minutes to load
so you could play pong

<pong>

advantage
you know is going to take long
so why not go overboard

in short we give an explanation 
like the cuase for the delay
or we have to entertain the user 
while waiting 

there's one other category: in time

<in time>

example: download

in contrast to indetermined progress we have a determined progress.
we know what needs to be loaded and how fast we can load it.

<determined progress>

nowadays with streaming etc. this is getting pretty rare.

example: games loading

on top many games rather rely on "fake it till you make it" to load data
for example
squeezing through tight spaces in a game 
reduces viewport
so when the player is locked into a place 
loading of new scenries can be done in the background 

also determined because we know the stages
textures, sounds, logic
that need to be loaded

many games nowadays resort to indermined progress indicators because
this effect is just to well known:

<meme>

so for today, we skip this category
seems outdated

to summarize

<summary>

now: 0 to ~50ms
in a moment: ~50ms to 10 seconds
later: over 10 seconds

lets create a widget for everything

but we're in a dilemma
if "fake is till you make it" is not possible
and with the internet as a factor
waiting might a very short or quite a long time
we dont want to show nothing for a long time
and we also don't want to bombard the user with an explanation or entertainment if the loading takes a very short time

so we have to slowly escalate and transistion between the states

lets use the famous flutter logo as our content

<widgetContent>

for the transistion between now and in a moment
 we can use a scrim
 a scrim just fades out the underlying content
as you can see it covers short times 

<widgetScrim>

for the "in a moment" category 
old friend 
the indetermined progress indicator
can't go wrong with that 
every generation alive knows this widget

<widgetIndicator>

longer than 10 seconds we show something more
in this example just a lame excuse

<widgetTimeout>

putting it altogether it looks like this:

<waiting>

well this takes a lot of animations and timing to achieve
if only this would be a flutter package
ready to use 

<qrCode>

lucky you
wrote a waiting widget that does that
if you scan this qr code
you'll find the package for the waiting widget
customizable
exchange the loading indicator for the "in a moment" category
define a widget for the "later" category
